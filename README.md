# Ant-s-Password-Generator
-----Deployment-----
Instead of a series of prompts, 4 check boxes appear to ask the user the criteria desired for their password.
Upon clicking the Generate Password Button either:
1.) If no boxes are checked the user is alerted that no boxes were checked. No password will be generated.
2.) If 1 or all boxes are checked, the user is them prompted for a length.

The prompt asks for a number between 8 and 128, and contains exception handlers otherwise:
1.) If a user enters a value that not a number, an alert will appear and no password will be generated.
2.) If a user enters a value less than or greater than the range, an alert will appear and no password will be generated.
3.) If a user doesn't try to break my app and they enter and number between 8 and 128 , they'll be rewarded with a generated random password with their set criteria.


Console logged are the possible additives of the password upon generation.
