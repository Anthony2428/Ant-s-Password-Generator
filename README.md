Instead of a series of prompts, 4 check boxes appear to ask the user the criteria desired for their password.</br>
Upon clicking the Generate Password Button either:</br>
1.) If no boxes are checked the user is alerted that no boxes were checked. No password will be generated.</br>
2.) If 1 or all boxes are checked, the user is them prompted for a length.</br></br>

The prompt asks for a number between 8 and 128, and contains exception handlers otherwise:</br>
1.) If a user enters a value that not a number, an alert will appear and no password will be generated.</br>
2.) If a user enters a value less than or greater than the range, an alert will appear and no password will be generated.</br>
3.) If a user doesn't try to break my app and they enter and number between 8 and 128 , they'll be rewarded with a generated random password with their set criteria.</br></br>

Console logged are the possible additives of the password upon generation.</br>
